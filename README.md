# Comparing-OLS-and-CLS-using-K-Fold-Cross-Validation
The objective was to implement constrained least squares (CLS) and compare the results
to ordinary least squares (OLS) using k-fold cross validation in order to determine which
techniques provided a better estimate of the linear regression equation coefficients. The results were
generated by applying both techniques and running 10 passes of 5-fold cross validation on
instructor provided data. The mean and standard deviation were reported when applying CLS and
OLS to both training and testing data sets. The more effective technique will be the technique that
provides a better model of the data, which will be confirmed through statistical summary. For both
the training and testing data sets, CLS provided a lower standard deviation compared to OLS,
suggesting that CLS provided a better model of the data. Due to the constraint applied in CLS, it
was able to better handle the outliers within the data compared to OLS. This allowed CLS to better
model the data making it the more effective technique between the two.
