# Comparing-OLS-and-CLS-using-K-Fold-Cross-Validation
- The objective was to implement constrained least squares (CLS) and compare the results to ordinary least squares (OLS) using k-fold cross validation in order to determine which techniques provided a better estimate of the linear regression equation coefficients.
